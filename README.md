## Face-Generator

###Using GAN to generate human faces (Tensorflow).

Please read my [blog](https://medium.com/@shivajbd/generating-human-faces-using-adversarial-network-960863bc1deb) for this project.

### Introduction

In this project, I am generating new human faces which probably does not exist in real life.
It would be quite obvious for you that I will be using the generative adversarial network(GAN) for the task.
I am using CelebA dataset for training the network. This dataset contains 2,00,000 images of well-known people.

### Results

Following are the generated faces after training.
